## RAMAS Risk Calc software

-[about](https://www.ramas.com/risk-calc-4-0). The software RAMAS Risk Calc implements probability bounds analysis under the Windows operating system. Ferson et al. [2001] derived probability bounds for a variety of circumstances in which a precise distribution cannot be reliably determined and empirical information is limited. These derivations have been incorporated into the sot~ware Risk Calc in a way that allows users to select probability bounds very conveniently by specifying what they know about a distribution.
