# interval analysis

Intervals play a central role in the [probability bounds analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_bounds_analysis).

```{hint}
the key point of the definitions of basic arithmetic operations between intervals is **computing with intervals is computing with sets**.
```

Interval arithmetics can be defined as :

$$
bla bla
$$

A key consideration of the propagation of interval objects is the *dependency* issue, which hinders the naive uses of interval arithmetic in many problems as it often yields inflated interval outputs. The *image set* under a real-valued function mapping $f$ as $x$ varies through a given interval $[X]$ can be defined as:

$$
f(X) = \{ f(x): x \in X \}
$$
