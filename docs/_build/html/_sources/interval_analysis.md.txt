Code blocks in Markdown can be created in various ways.

    Indenting content by 4 spaces.
    This will not have any syntax highlighting.


```
Wrapping text with triple backticks also works.
This will have default syntax highlighting (highlighting a few words and "strings").
```

```python
print("And with the triple backticks syntax, you can have syntax highlighting.")
```

```none
print("Or disable all syntax highlighting.")
```

There's a lot of power hidden underneath the triple backticks in MyST Markdown,
