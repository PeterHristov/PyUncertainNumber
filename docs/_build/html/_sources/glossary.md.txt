- The **Measurand** field reveals the interpretation of what is being estimated or characterised with the number.

- The **Variability**  field’s entry expresses what statement is being made about the variability, if any, that is represented by the uncertain number.

- The **Ensemble** field specifies the population (or reference class) represented by the aleatory variation.

- The **Dependence** field could be implemented in various ways.

- The **Uncertainty** field identifies the nature of the epistemic uncertainty embodied in the uncertain number.

- **best possible**: it cannot be further reduced for the given information without excluding the true value.

- **rigorous** approach, i.e. it guarantees that if the input interval contains the “true” value of the uncertain number then the output interval will also enclose the “true” value.
