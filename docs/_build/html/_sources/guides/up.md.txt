# Propagation

Methods to efficiently propagate different types of uncertainty through computational models are of vital interests.
`PyUncertainNumber` includes strategies for black box uncertainty propagation as well as a library of functions for PBA (Probability Bounds Analysis) if the code can be modified. `PyUncertainNumber` provides a series of uncertainty propagation methods.
