This repository will serve as a sharepoint where DAWS2 related codes, documents and meeting minutes are put in one repository for easier reference. Progress of develpments are can be tracked herein. Note the codes for the `Python library` and `GUI` under development may not necessarily be stored here. But in order for this repo to be a hub, a reference link and relevant codes (e.g. Jupyter notebook) that demonstrate how these developtments work will be put here.


For meeting minutes refer to this [place](/meeting_minutes/) and to track progress, refer to [this location](./docs/progress.md)
